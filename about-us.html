                    <h3>What is Accounting?</h3>
                    <br>

                    <h4>The accounting process includes summarizing, analyzing, and reporting these transactions to oversight agencies, regulators, and tax collection entities.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4>We use Corporate Accounting , Public Accounting , Goverment Accounting and Forensic Accounting.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4>While accounting does require a complex set of skills and abilities, as well as excellent attention to detail, it really isn't any more difficult than many of the other popular fields of study that lead to excellent lifelong career
                        opportunities.

                    <br>
                    <h4>Accounting isn't hard-core math. It's basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Possibly some light, entry-level algebra, but that's it. You don't have to understand calculus.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4>All accounting students are required to take courses in Algebra and Statistics in their first two years of study. These mathematic courses usually include College Algebra, Elementary Statistics and Business Statistics. As a student
                        dives deeper into the major, they will come across many new math classes.</h4>
