                    <h3>Data privacy focuses on issues related to collecting, storing and retaining data, as well as data transfers within applicable regulations and laws, such as GDPR and HIPAA.</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Data privacy is a subset of data security. That is, data privacy can't exist without data security.</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Data privacy isn't easy or automatic, and many businesses struggle to meet requirements and counter threats in an ever-changing regulatory and security landscape.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Proper data privacy compliance can yield four major benefits for a business, including: Lower storage costs , Better data use , Better bussiness reputation and brand , Regulatory compilance etc...</h4>

                    <h3>Why is data privacy important?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h3>When data that should kept private gets in the wrong hands, bad things can happen.</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h4>A data breach at a goverment agency can, for example, put top secret information in the hands of the enemy state.</h4>

                    <br>
                    <h3> There are two primary types:</h3>

                    <h4>Non-sensitive PII — Information that is already in the public record, such as a phone book and online directory.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) — Data that cannot be used to identify a person. Examples include device IDs orcookies. However, some privacy laws hold that even cookies can be considered personal data, because they
                        can leave traces that could be used in combination with other identifiers to establish a person’s identity.
